#### OUR HISTORY
# Patient, collaborative investors, experts at growing small businesses
We founded Hadley Capital nearly 20 years ago specifically to invest in and grow small businesses. Since that time, we have completed more than 20 acquisitions, partnering with management teams, families and owner/executives to deliver results for our companies and investors.

#### Small company success
We focus exclusively on buying small, profitable companies. We are an ideal partner for owners seeking liquidity, generational transition, capital for growth or recapitalization. Over the years we have consistently demonstrated a knack for working collaboratively and productively with management teams to achieve the company’s goals.

#### Patient investors
We seek to invest in improvements that build on past successes. We are patient investors with a “first, do no harm” philosophy, guiding and supporting decisions based on meeting long-term growth objectives. We are not looking to flip companies.

#### Capital for acquisitions
Because of our approach and track record, we have been successful in raising committed equity capital from investors to acquire small companies. We are big investors in our own funds, a level of personal commitment that business owners and management teams appreciate.
